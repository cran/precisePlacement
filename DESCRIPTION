Description: Provides a selection of tools that make it easier to place elements onto a (base R) plot exactly where you want them. It allows users to identify points and distances on a plot in terms of inches, pixels, margin lines, data units, and proportions of the plotting space, all in a manner more simple than manipulating par().
